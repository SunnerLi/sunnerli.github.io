<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I work as a researcher near [TCC Group Holdings](https://www.tccgroupholdings.com/en/) in Taoyuan. My goal is to **advance AI models (particularly generative models) or systems to enhance their capabilities**, enabling applications across diverse modalities and domain. I am currently focused on developing systems by leveraging foundation models, prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation. 

I initially worked as a Computer Vision and Deep Learning Research Engineer, and later as an AI Engineer at [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com/). I obtained my Master's degree in Institute of Computer Science and Engineering from [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nycu.edu.tw/nycu/en/index), where I was advised by [Prof. Yu-Tai Ching](https://www.cs.nycu.edu.tw/members/detail/ytc) and worked with [Prof. Wei-Chen Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/) and [Dr. Li Su](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lisu/index_en.html). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering from [National Taipei University](https://new.ntpu.edu.tw/), where I collaborated with [Prof. Bor-Shing Lin](https://web.ntpu.edu.tw/~bslin/). 

Outside of work, **I am also looking for my life partner and hope to be your sunshine ☀️.** Please feel free to contact me if you're interested.
